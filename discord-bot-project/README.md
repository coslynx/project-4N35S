## Programming Languages
- Node.js will be used for backend development.
- JavaScript will be used for frontend development for Discord bot commands.

## APIs
- Discord API will be integrated for bot functionalities like messaging, streaming, and user interactions.

## Packages and Libraries
- Discord.js (v13.1.0) for interacting with the Discord API efficiently.
- Axios (v0.24.0) for making HTTP requests to fetch video content.
- Express (v4.17.1) for setting up a web server to host the bot.
- Mongoose (v6.0.10) for managing user profiles, preferences, and viewing history.
- Socket.io (v4.1.3) for real-time communication between users watching the same content.

## Rationale
- Node.js is chosen for its asynchronous event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling multiple user interactions in real-time.
- JavaScript is selected for frontend development due to its compatibility with Discord bot commands and ease of use.
- Discord API is essential for integrating bot functionalities seamlessly within the Discord platform.
- Discord.js is a popular library for Node.js that simplifies interactions with the Discord API.
- Axios is a lightweight HTTP client for fetching video content efficiently.
- Express is a fast and minimalist web framework for setting up the bot's web server.
- Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a straightforward way to manage user data.
- Socket.io enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between users for a more interactive experience.
